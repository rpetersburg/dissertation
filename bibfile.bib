	abstract = {The history of astrometry, the branch of astronomy dealing with the positions of celestial objects, is a lengthy and complex chronicle, having its origins in the earliest records of astronomical observations more than two thousand years ago, and extending to the high accuracy observations being made from space today. Improved star positions progressively opened up and advanced fundamental fields of scientific enquiry, including our understanding of the scale of the solar system, the details of the Earth's motion through space, and the comprehension and acceptance of Newtonianism. They also proved crucial to the
practical task of maritime navigation. Over the past 400 years, during which positional accuracy has improved roughly logarithmically with time, the distances to the nearest stars were triangulated, making use of the extended measurement baseline given by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This led to quantifying the extravagantly vast scale of the Universe, to a determination of the physical properties of stars, and to the resulting characterisation of the structure, dynamics and origin of our Galaxy. After a period in the middle years of the twentieth century in which accuracy improvements were greatly hampered by the perturbing effects of the Earth's atmosphere, ultra-high accuracies of star positions from space platforms have led to a renewed advance in this fundamental science over the past few years.},

	abstract = {Unlike most other planet-detection techniques, gravitational microlensing does not rely on detection of photons from either the host or the planet. Rather, planets are discovered by their gravitational perturbation of light from a more distant source. I review the
fundamental concepts of microlensing planet searches and discuss their practical application. I show how the strengths and peculiarities of the method flow from the basic manner in which planets are discovered. In particular, microlensing is sensitive to very low-mass planets on wide orbits and free-floating planets, and can be used to search for planets orbiting host stars with a broad range of masses and Galactocentric distances. However, microlensing events are rare and cannot be predicted in advance, the majority of the host stars are extremely faint, and the planetary signals typically last less than a day. These strengths motivate microlensing searches as powerful, complementary probes of unexplored parameter space that have already provided important
constraints on the demographics of planets beyond the “snow
line.” However, the real-world challenges associated with the
practical application of the method have driven the organization and evolution of the microlensing field and will continue to drive future developments from next-generation ground-based experiments through possible future space-based missions.},

	abstract = {Most of the exoplanets known today have been discovered by indirect techniques, based on the study of the host star radial velocity or photometric temporal variations. These detections allowed the study of the planet populations in the first 5–8 AU from the central stars and have provided precious information on the way planets form and evolve at such separations. Direct imaging on 8–10 m class telescopes allows the detection of giant planets at larger separations (currently typically more than 5–10 AU) complementing the indirect techniques. So far, only a few planets have been imaged around young stars, but each of them provides an opportunity for unique dedicated studies of their orbital, physical and atmospheric properties and sometimes also on the interaction with the ‘second-generation’, debris discs. These few detections already challenge formation theories. In this paper, I present the results of direct imaging surveys obtained so far, and what they already tell us about giant planet (GP) formation and evolution. Individual and emblematic cases are detailed; they illustrate what future instruments will routinely deliver for a much larger number of stars. I also point out the limitations of this approach, as well as the needs for further work in terms of planet formation modelling. I finally present the progress expected in direct imaging in the near future, thanks in particular to forthcoming planet imagers on 8–10 m class telescopes.},

	abstract = {Photometry with the transit method has arguably been the most successful exoplanet discovery method to date. A short overview about the rise of that method to its present status is given. The method's strength is the rich set of parameters that can be obtained from transiting planets, in particular in combination with radial velocity observations; the basic principles of these parameters are given. The method has however also drawbacks, which are the low probability that transits appear in randomly oriented planet systems and the presence of astrophysical phenomena that may mimic transits and give rise to false detection positives. In the second part, we outline the main factors that
determine the design of transit surveys, such as the size of the survey sample, the temporal coverage, the detection precision, the sample brightness and the methods to extract transit events from observed light curves. Lastly, an overview over past, current, and future transit surveys is given. For these surveys we indicate their basic instrument configuration and their planet catch, including the ranges of planet sizes and stellar magnitudes that were encountered. Current and future transit detection experiments concentrate primarily on bright or special targets, and we expect that the transit method remains a principal driver of exoplanet science, through new discoveries to be made and through the development of new generations of instruments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Absorption by molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere strongly affects ground-based astronomical observations. The resulting absorption line strength and shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e. pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved. Usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS) are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope time. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic transmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of the observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by means of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this way, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed without any additional calibration observations of TSS.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We evaluate the quality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of archival ESO-VLT/X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Thanks to the wavelength coverage from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}U{\textless}i/{\textgreater} to the {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band, X-Shooter is well suited to investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect to the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the code, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles. These investigations are based on two figures of merit, {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}off{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}res{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, that describe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the corrections. We also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correction achieved with molecfit to the classical method based on a telluric standard star.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The evaluation of the telluric correction with molecfit shows a convincing removal of atmospheric absorption features. The comparison with the classical method reveals that molecfit performs better because it is not prone to the bad continuum reconstruction, noise, and intrinsic spectral features introduced by the telluric standard star.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Fitted synthetic transmission spectra are an excellent alternative to the correction based on telluric standard stars.

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The interaction of the light from astronomical objects with the constituents of the Earth’s atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the science targets, therefore using precious observing time. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We present molecfit, a tool to correct for telluric absorption lines based on synthetic modelling of the Earth’s atmospheric transmission.

The atmospheric profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative of a given observatory’s climate, of local meteorological data, and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability, and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory into account.

The accuracy reached is comparable to or better than the typical accuracy achieved using a telluric standard star observation. The availability of such a general tool for telluric absorption correction may improve future observational and analysing strategies, as well as empower users of archival data.},

	abstract = {Planets have been detected orbiting several solar-type stars with the use of high-precision radial velocity (vr) measurements. While changes in vr can be measured with an accuracy of a few meters per second, there has been relatively little study of how other astrophysical processes, such as magnetic activity, may affect the observed velocities. In this paper, we use published data and simple models to explore the contributions to vr from two
activity-related sources, starspots and convective inhomogeneities, as these features rotate across the disk and evolve in time.

Radial velocity perturbations due to both of these sources increase with rotation and the level of surface activity. Our models indicate that for solar-age G stars, the amplitude of perturbations due to spots is AS {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5 m s-1, increasing to AS {\textasciitilde} 30-50 m s-1 for Hyades-age G stars. If fS is the starspot area coverage, we find that
AS{\textasciitilde}f0.9Sv sin i. The effects of convective inhomogeneities (as observed in line bisector variations) appear to depend on both rotation and spectral type. Young (active) F and G dwarfs can have convective vr perturbations with amplitudes AC {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 50 m s-1, while vr amplitudes are reduced for stars with lower v sin i and cooler
Teff. We show that vr data from the literature display similar trends with v sin i and Teff. AS and AC will be strongest at or near timescales related to magnetic activity variations: rotation, active region growth and decay, and activity cycles. Thus, knowledge of these timescales and typical AS and AC values are important in searching for extrasolar planets, especially those around younger, more active stars or those with small vr reflex amplitudes (i.e., {\textless}{\textasciitilde}20 m s-1). We discuss implications of our results for current planet detections and planet search strategies.},

In this paper, we present the new Two-level Structure Tracking (TST) algorithm, based on a two-level representation of granulation, which allows us to monitor the characteristics of identified photospheric structures during their duration. TST is also able to retrieve horizontal velocity maps from measured granule displacements. Direct comparison of the results from different works describing granular evolution is often not possible as discrepancies stemming from the use of different procedures or from different data cannot be distinguished. Here, three different solar granulation broadband time series, acquired at THEMIS in July 1999, at NSO-DST in October 1996, and at SVST in June 1995, with different spatial and temporal resolutions, are coherently analyzed via the same TST procedure, allowing direct comparison of the results. Among the obtained results, we confirm the dynamical heterogeneity of photospheric small scale structures pointed out by granular lifetime histograms, characterized by a stretched exponential function. Furthermore, by monitoring the breaking-up of a granule and the movements of its neighbours and of its fragments, we found evidence of how an exploding granule may produce a divergence signal on spatial and temporal mesogranular scales.},

	abstract = {The fibre-fed echelle spectrograph of Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ELODIE, is presented. This instrument has been in operation since the end of 1993 on the 1.93 m telescope. ELODIE is designed as an updated version of the cross-correlation spectrometer CORAVEL, to perform very accurate radial velocity measurements such as needed in the search, by Doppler shift, for brown-dwarfs or giant planets orbiting around nearby stars. In one single exposure a spectrum at a resolution of 42000 (λ/\{DELTA\}λ) ranging from 3906A to 6811A is recorded on a
1024x1024 CCD. This performance is achieved by using a tanθ=4
echelle grating and a combination of a prism and a grism as
cross-disperser. An automatic on-line data treatment reduces all the ELODIE echelle spectra and computes cross-correlation functions. The instrument design and the data reduction algorithms are described in this paper. The efficiency and accuracy of the instrument and its long term instrumental stability allow us to measure radial velocities with an accuracy better than 15m/s for stars up to 9th magnitude in less than 30 minutes exposure time. Observations of 16th magnitude stars are also possible to measure velocities at about 1km/s accuracy. For classic spectroscopic studies (S/N{\textgreater}100) 9th magnitude stars can be observed in one hour exposure time.},

	abstract = {A new generation of “Extreme Precision” astronomical spectrometers is currently being designed to detect Earth-mass planets orbiting nearby stars using the Doppler method. Measuring the subtle shifts in stellar absorption features resulting from stellar radial velocity variations of tens of centimeters per second is a significant technological challenge. Currently, there are several instruments around the world capable of measuring stellar radial velocities at the 1 m s−1 level. Moving beyond this level of precision, CCD effects may become important and could limit the ultimate measurement precision in complex ways. Here, we simulate the impact of Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) in CCDs on radial velocity measurements. We show that CTI can manifest as a significant source of systematic error in high precision Doppler measurements, though these effects can likely be mitigated using optimized observing strategies and empirical flux corrections.},

	abstract = {Microresonator frequency combs can be an enabling technology for optical frequency synthesis and timekeeping in low size, weight, and power architectures. Such systems require comb operation in low-noise, phase-coherent states such as solitons, with broad spectral bandwidths (e.g., octave-spanning) for self-referencing to detect the carrier-envelope offset frequency. However, accessing such states is complicated by thermo-optic dispersion. For example, in the Si3N4 platform, precisely dispersion-engineered structures can support broadband operation, but microsecond thermal time constants often require fast pump power or frequency control to stabilize the solitons. In contrast, here we consider how broadband soliton states can be accessed with simple pump laser frequency tuning, at a rate much slower than the thermal dynamics. We demonstrate octave-spanning soliton frequency combs in Si3N4 microresonators, including the generation of a multi-soliton state with a pump power near 40 mW and a single-soliton state with a pump power near 120 mW. We also develop a simplified two-step analysis to explain how these states are accessed without fast control of the pump laser, and outline the required thermal properties for such operation. Our model agrees with experimental results as well as numerical simulations based on a Lugiato–Lefever equation that incorporates thermo-optic dispersion. Moreover, it also explains an experimental observation that a member of an adjacent mode family on the red-detuned side of the pump mode can mitigate the thermal requirements for accessing soliton states.},

We developed a LFC based calibration system for the high-resolution echelle spectrograph at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), located at the Teide observatory, Tenerife, Canary Islands.

	abstract = {Kerr nonlinearity-based frequency combs and solitons have been generated from on-chip microresonators. The initiation of the combs requires global or local anomalous dispersion which leads to many limitations, such as material choice, film thickness, and spectral ranges where combs can be generated, as well as fabrication challenges. Using a concentric racetrack-shaped resonator, we show that such constraints can be lifted and resonator dispersion can be engineered to be anomalous over moderately broad bandwidth. We demonstrate anomalous dispersion in a 300 nm thick silicon nitride film, suitable for semiconductor manufacturing but previously thought to result in waveguides with high normal dispersion. Together with a mode-selective, tapered coupling scheme, we generate coherent mode-locked frequency combs. Our method can realize anomalous dispersion for resonators at almost any wavelength and simultaneously achieve material and process compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Earth-like planets, dark energy and variability of fundamental physical constants can be discovered by observing wavelength shifts in the optical spectra of astronomical objects1-5. These wavelength shifts are so tiny that exquisitely accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers is required. Laser frequency combs, broadband spectra of laser lines with absolutely known optical frequencies, are uniquely suited for this purpose6-13, provided their lines are resolved by the spectrometer. Generating such astronomical laser frequency combs (`astrocombs') remains challenging. Here, a microphotonic astrocomb is demonstrated via temporal dissipative Kerr solitons14-16 in photonic-chip-based silicon nitride microresonators17, directly providing a spurious-free spectrum of resolvable calibration lines. Sub-harmonically driven by temporally structured light18, the astrocomb is stabilized to a frequency standard, resulting in absolute calibration with a precision of 25 cm s-1 (radial velocity equivalent), relevant for Earth-like planet detection and cosmological research. The microphotonic technology can be extended in spectral span17,19-24, further boosting the calibration precision.},

A central requirement is a precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrographs allowing for extraction of subtle wavelength shifts from the spectra of stars and quasars. Here, we present an all-fiber, 400 nm wide near-infrared frequency comb based on electro-optic modulation with 14.5 GHz comb line spacing. Tests on the high-resolution, near-infrared spectrometer GIANO-B show a photon-noise limited calibration precision of \&lt; 10 cms as required for Earth-like planet detection. Moreover, the presented comb provides detailed insight into particularities of the spectrograph such as detector inhomogeneities and differential spectrograph drifts. The system is validated in on-sky observations of a radial velocity standard star (HD221354) and telluric atmospheric absorption features. The advantages of the system include simplicity, robustness and turn-key operation, features that are valuable at the observation sites.},

Since aluminum nitride exhibits both quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, the spectra feature simultaneous contributions from numerous nonlinear mechanisms: supercontinuum generation, difference-frequency generation, second-harmonic generation, and third-harmonic generation. As one application of integrating multiple nonlinear processes, we measure and stabilize the carrier-envelope-offset frequency of a laser comb by direct photodetection of the output light. Additionally, we generate approximately 0.3 mW of broadband light in the 3000- and 4000-nm spectral region, which is potentially useful for molecular spectroscopy. The combination of broadband light generation from the visible through the midinfrared, combined with simplified self-referencing, provides a path towards robust comb systems for spectroscopy and metrology in the field.},

instrument performance and scanning law. We use two approaches to estimate detectable planetary systems: one based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the astrometric signature per field crossing, easily
reproducible and allowing comparisons with previous estimates, and a new and more robust metric based on orbit fitting to the simulated satellite data. With some plausible assumptions on planet occurrences, we find that some 21,000 (±6000) high-mass ({\textasciitilde}1-15M J)

Our measurements are combined with results from seven previously published thorium line lists to re-optimize the energy levels of neutral, singly, and doubly ionized thorium (Th I, Th II, and Th III). Using the optimized level values, we calculate accurate Ritz wavelengths for 19, 874 thorium lines between 250 nm and 5500 nm (40, 000 cm–1 to 1800 cm–1). We have also found 102 new thorium energy levels. A systematic analysis of previous measurements in light of our new results allows us to identify and propose corrections for systematic errors in Palmer \& Engleman and typographical errors and incorrect classifications in Kerber et al. We also found a large scatter with respect to the thorium line list of Lovis \& Pepe. We anticipate that our Ritz wavelengths will lead to improved measurement accuracy for current and future spectrographs that make use of thorium-argon or thorium-neon lamps as calibration standards.},

Based on this experience, our consortium is developing a high accuracy near-infrared RV spectrograph covering YJH bands to detect and characterize low-mass planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs. It will allow RV measurements at the 1-m/s level and will look for habitable planets around M- type stars by following up the candidates found by the upcoming space missions TESS, CHEOPS and later PLATO. NIRPS and HARPS, working simultaneously on the ESO 3.6m are bound to become a single powerful high-resolution, high-fidelity spectrograph covering from 0.4 to 1.8 micron. NIRPS will complement HARPS in validating earth-like planets found around G and K-type stars whose signal is at the same order of magnitude than the stellar noise. Because at equal resolving power the overall dimensions of a spectrograph vary linearly with the input beam étendue, spectrograph designed for seeing-limited observations are large and expensive. NIRPS will use a high order adaptive optics system to couple the starlight into a fiber corresponding to 0.4” on the sky as efficiently or better than HARPS or ESPRESSO couple the light 0.9” fiber. This allows the spectrograph to be very compact, more thermally stable and less costly. Using a custom tan(θ)=4 dispersion grating in combination with a start-of-the-art Hawaii4RG detector makes NIRPS very efficient with complete coverage of the YJH bands at 110’000 resolution. NIRPS works in a regime that is in-between the usual multi-mode (MM) where 1000’s of modes propagates in the fiber and the single mode well suited for perfect optical systems. This regime called few-modes regime is prone to modal noise- Results from a significant R and D effort made to characterize and circumvent the modal noise show that this contribution to the performance budget shall not preclude the RV performance to be achieved.},

observations of sigma-Dra we report 1.7m/s precision for a period of
seven months and 2.1m/s for HD 9407 over a period of 2 months. PARAS is
capable of a single-shot spectral coverage of 3800A - 9500A at a
resolution of about 67,000. The RV results were obtained between 3800A

conditions of temperature with a precision of 0.01 - 0.02C (rms) at
25.55C, and enclosed in a vacuum vessel at pressure of 0.1 +/-0.03 mbar.
The blaze peak efficiency of the spectrograph between 5000A and 6500A,

	abstract = {Context. In 2009 we started an intense radial-velocity monitoring of a 
few nearby, slowly-rotating and quiet solar-type stars within the
dedicated HARPS-Upgrade GTO program. Aims: The goal of this
campaign is to gather very-precise radial-velocity data with high
cadence and continuity to detect tiny signatures of very-low-mass stars
that are potentially present in the habitable zone of their parent
stars. Methods: Ten stars were selected among the most stable
stars of the original HARPS high-precision program that are uniformly
spread in hour angle, such that three to four of them are observable at
any time of the year. For each star we recorded 50 data points spread
over the observing season. The data points consist of three nightly
observations with a total integration time of 10 min each and are
separated by two hours. This is an observational strategy adopted to
minimize stellar pulsation and granulation noise. Results: We
present the first results of this ambitious program. The radial-velocity
data and the orbital parameters of five new and one confirmed low-mass
planets around the stars HD 20794, HD
85512, and HD 192310 are reported and
discussed, among which is a system of three super-Earths and one that
harbors a 3.6 M⊕-planet at the inner edge of the
habitable zone. Conclusions: This result already confirms
previous indications that low-mass planets seem to be very frequent
around solar-type stars and that this may occur with a frequency higher
than 30\%.

However, photospheric velocities are imprinted differently in a high-resolution spectrum than are Keplerian Doppler shifts. Photospheric activity produces subtle differences in the shapes of absorption lines due to differences in how temperature or pressure affects the atomic transitions. In contrast, Keplerian Doppler shifts affect every spectral line in the same way. With a high enough signal-to-noise (S/N) and resolution, statistical techniques can exploit differences in spectra to disentangle the photospheric velocities and detect lower-amplitude exoplanet signals. We use simulated disk-integrated time-series spectra and principal component analysis (PCA) to show that photospheric signals introduce spectral line variability that is distinct from that of Doppler shifts. We quantify the impact of instrumental resolution and S/N for this work.},

The presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this bold precision are summarized here. Beginning with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph, technological advances for precision radial velocity (RV) measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to improve upon the state of the art, producing even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision RV community include distinguishing center of mass (COM) Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities (time correlated noise) and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. COM velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. However, higher precision RV measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds, to confirm and characterize detections from transit missions, and to provide mass measurements for other space-based missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

In this chapter we describe how the technique works, and the current precision and limitations. We then review its major successes in the field of exoplanets. With more than 250 planet detections, it is the most prolific technique to date and has led to many milestone discoveries, such as hot Jupiters, multiplanet systems, transiting planets around bright stars, the planet-metallicity correlation, planets around M dwarfs and intermediate-mass stars, and recently, the emergence of a population of low-mass planets: Neptune-mass planets and super-Earths. In the near future radial velocities are expected to systematically explore the domain of rocky and icy planets down to a few Earth masses close to the habitable zone of their parent star. Radial velocity measurements will also be used to provide the necessary follow-up observations of transiting candidates detected by space missions. Finally, we also note alternative radial velocity techniques that may play an important role in the future.},

	abstract = {Mechanical models of planet formation can't fully explain the diversity in observed system architectures found over the last couple of decades. Because stellar photospheres evolve slowly, we can use them as fossil records of the initial conditions in protoplanetary disks.
In Chapter 2 we developed a new spectral analysis procedure to derive surface gravities consistent with those of asteroseismology without the use of external constraints. Compared to a set of 42 Kepler stars with asteroseismically determined log g, our gravities show a constant offset of 0.01 dex and a root mean square (RMS) scatter of 0.05 dex.
In Chapter 3 we used this new procedure to determine the stellar properties and abundances of more than 1600 planet search stars, including 280 known planet hosts. Using a single line list to fit model spectra to observations, we determined effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, macroturbulence, projected rotational velocity, absolute radial velocity, and abundances of 15 'elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, \& Y) for all stars. We also found and corrected residual trends in our abundances with respect to Teff. These trends, though small, are shared with published abundances and we identified problems with our model atmosphere grids as the likely cause.
In Chapter 4 we used the abundances in our catalog to constrain the distribution of C/O and Mg/Si ratios for main sequence stars between 4800 K and 6100 K. The C/O ratio peaks at {\textasciitilde} 0.5 and none of the 837 stars has C/O {\textgreater} 0.8. This implies that all planetary systems will form in disks similar to that of the solar system, with the composition of rocky planets determined by the ratio of Mg/Si. About 40\% of the systems have Mg/Si {\textless} 1, which may result in terrestrial planet geology that is very silicon rich compared to rocky planets around the Sun. The remaining 60\% have 1 ≤ Mg/Si {\textless} 2, resulting in geology much like that of the Earth. Known planet hosts have very similar distributions of C/O and Mg/Si to that of the sample as a whole.
In Chapter 5 we compared the carbon to oxygen ratios in hot Jupiter atmospheres to the C/O ratios of their host stars. If the planets formed close to their present locations, the C/O ratios should be nearly the same. If the planets migrated to their current locations after forming and accreting their atmospheres beyond the snow line they should show an enhanced C/O ratio. Though the uncertainties in C/O measurements of hot Jupiter atmospheres are currently too large for precise constraints, the ratios suggest the planets did not form near their host stars. We predict most hot Jupiters formed beyond the snow line and migrated to their current locations.
Chemistry is one of the important initial conditions of planet formation. Our catalog will help place constraints on formation models by identifying differences in abundance patterns between hosts with similar stellar properties but different system architectures. We are excited to be involved in this work and present ideas for future prospects in the field.},

Where appropriate, we have used off-the-shelf, commercial components with demonstrated long-term performance to accelerate the development timescale of this instrument. Our system combines for the first time the advantages of passively stabilized etalons for optical and near-infrared wavelengths with the laser-locking technique demonstrated for single-mode fiber etalons. We realize uncertainties in the position of one etalon line at the 10 cms−1 level in individual measurements taken at 4 Hz. When binning the data over 10 s, we are able to trace the etalon line with a precision of better than 3 cms−1. We present data obtained during a week of continuous operation where we detect (and correct for) the predicted, but previously unobserved shrinking of the etalon Zerodur spacer corresponding to a shift of 13 cms−1 per day.},

	abstract = {As the first successful technique used to detect exoplanets orbiting distant stars, the Radial Velocity Method aims to detect a periodic Doppler shift in a star's spectrum. We introduce a new, mathematically rigorous, approach to detect such a signal that accounts for functional relationships of neighboring wavelengths, minimizes the role of wavelength interpolation, accounts for heteroskedastic noise, and easily allows for statistical inference. Using Hermite-Gaussian functions, we show that the problem of detecting a Doppler shift in the spectrum can be reduced to linear regression in many settings. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method is able to accurately estimate an individual spectrum's radial velocity with precision below 0.3 m/s. Furthermore, the new method outperforms the traditional Cross-Correlation Function approach by reducing the root mean squared error up to 15 cm/s. The proposed method is also demonstrated on a new set of observations from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES) for the star 51 Pegasi, and successfully recovers estimates that agree well with previous studies of this planetary system.

orbiting nearby stars. Two main techniques are used to obtain precision
Doppler measurements at optical wavelengths. The first approach is the
gas cell method, which consists of least-squares matching of the
spectrum of iodine imprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second
method relies on the construction of a stabilized spectrograph
externally calibrated in wavelength. The most precise stabilized
spectrometer in operation is the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet
Searcher (HARPS), operated by the European Southern Observatory in La
Silla Observatory, Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS
are typically obtained using the cross-correlation function (CCF)
technique. This technique consists of multiplying the stellar spectrum
by a weighted binary mask and finding the minimum of the product as a
function of the Doppler shift. It is known that CCF is suboptimal in
exploiting the Doppler information in the stellar spectrum. Here we
describe an algorithm to obtain precision radial velocity measurements
using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high
signal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. This
algorithm is implemented in our software HARPS-TERRA (Template-Enhanced
Radial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity
measurements on a representative sample of stars observed by HARPS are
used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed method. We show that,
compared with CCF, template matching provides a significant improvement
in accuracy, especially when applied to M dwarfs.},

spectrometers has become increasingly attractive since the advent of
diffraction-limited adaptive optics systems on large-aperture
telescopes. Spectrometers fed with these fibers can be made
significantly smaller than typical “seeing-limited”
instruments, greatly reducing cost and overall complexity. Importantly,
classical mode interference and speckle issues associated with
multi-mode fibers, also known as “modal noise,” are
mitigated when using SMFs, which also provide perfect radial and
azimuthal image scrambling. However, SMFs do support multiple
polarization modes, an issue that is generally ignored for larger-core
fibers given the large number of propagation modes. Since diffraction
gratings used in most high resolution astronomical instruments have
dispersive properties that are sensitive to incident polarization
changes, any birefringence variations in the fiber can cause variations
in the efficiency profile, degrading illumination stability. Here we
present a cautionary note outlining how the polarization properties of
SMFs can affect the radial velocity (RV) measurement precision of high
resolution spectrographs. This work is immediately relevant to the
rapidly expanding field of diffraction-limited, extreme precision RV
spectrographs that are currently being designed and built by a number of
groups.},

double-scrambler for high-resolution Doppler radial velocity
instruments. This device consists of a single optic: a high-index n
∼ 2 ball lens that exchanges the near and far fields between two
fibers. When used in conjunction with octagonal fibers, this device
yields very high scrambling gains (SGs) and greatly desensitizes the
fiber output from any input illumination variations, thereby stabilizing
the instrument profile of the spectrograph and improving the Doppler
measurement precision. The system is also highly insensitive to input
pupil variations, isolating the spectrograph from telescope illumination
variations and seeing changes. By selecting the appropriate glass and
lens diameter the highest efficiency is achieved when the fibers are
practically in contact with the lens surface, greatly simplifying the
alignment process when compared to classical double-scrambler systems.
This prototype double-scrambler has demonstrated significant performance
gains over previous systems, achieving SGs in excess of 10,000 with a
throughput of ∼87\% using uncoated Polymicro octagonal fibers. Adding
a circular fiber to the fiber train further increases the SG to
{\textgreater}20,000, limited by laboratory measurement error. While this fiber
system is designed for the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph, it
is more generally applicable to other instruments in the visible and
near-infrared. Given the simplicity and low cost, this fiber scrambler
could also easily be multiplexed for large multi-object instruments.},

of spectra as registered by two-dimensional detector arrays to a
one-dimensional format. Previously reported algorithms reconstruct
models for a mean one-dimensional spatial profile to assist a properly
weighted extraction. Aims: We outline a simple optimal extraction
algorithm (including error propagation), which is very suitable for
stabilised, fibre-fed spectrographs and does not model the spatial
profile shape. Methods: A high signal-to-noise ratio, master-flat
image serves as reference image and is directly used as an extraction
profile mask. Each extracted spectral value is the scaling factor
relative to the cross-section of the unnormalised master flat that
contains all information about the spatial profile, as well as
pixel-to-pixel variations, fringing, and blaze. The extracted spectrum
is measured relative to the flat spectrum. Results: Using echelle
spectra of the HARPS spectrograph we demonstrate a competitive
extraction performance in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio and show that
extracted spectra can be used for high precision radial velocity
measurement. Conclusions: Pre- or post-flat-fielding of the data
is not necessary, since all spectrograph inefficiencies inherent to the
extraction mask are automatically accounted for. Also the reconstruction
of the mean spatial profile by models is not needed, thereby reducing
the number of operations to extract spectra. Flat-relative optimal
extraction is a simple, efficient, and robust method that can be applied
easily to stabilised, fibre-fed spectrographs.

MINERVA’s unique combination of high precision and high cadence
over long time periods. In this work, we detail changes to the MINERVA
facility that have occurred since our previous paper. We then describe
MINERVA’s robotic control software, the process by which we
perform 1D spectral extraction, and our forward modeling Doppler
pipeline. In the process of improving our forward modeling procedure, we
found that our spectrograph’s intrinsic instrumental profile is
stable for at least nine months. Because of that, we characterized our
instrumental profile with a time-independent, cubic spline function
based on the profile in the cross dispersion direction, with which we
achieved a radial velocity precision similar to using a conventional
“sum-of-Gaussians” instrumental profile: 1.8 m
s-1 over 1.5 months on the RV standard star HD 122064.
Therefore, we conclude that the instrumental profile need not be
perfectly accurate as long as it is stable. In addition, we observed 51

We develop a new method for accessing the significance of a non-zero orbital eccentricity, namely Γ analysis, which combines the frequentist bootstrap approach with Bayesian analysis of each simulated data set. We find that the eccentricity estimations from the Γ analysis are generally consistent with the results from both the standard MCMC analysis and previous references. The Γ method is
particular useful for assessing the significance of small
eccentricities. Our results suggest that the current sample size is insufficient to draw robust conclusions about the roles of tidal interaction and perturbations in shaping the eccentricity distribution of short-period single-planet systems. We use a Bayesian population analysis to show that a mixture of analytical distributions is a good approximation of the underlying eccentricity distribution. For
short-period planets, we find the most probable values of parameters in the analytical functions given the observed eccentricities. These analytical functions can be used in theoretical investigations or as priors for the eccentricity distribution when analysing short-period planets. As the measurement precision improves and sample size
increases, the method can be applied to more complex parametrizations for the underlying distribution of eccentricity for extrasolar planetary systems.},

	abstract = {When applying the barycentric correction to a precise radial velocity 
measurement, it is common practice to calculate its value only at the
photon-weighted mid-point time of the observation instead of integrating
over the entire exposure. However, since the barycentric correction does
not change linearly with time, this leads to systematic errors in the
derived radial velocities. The typical magnitude of this second-order
effect is of order 10 cm s-1, but it depends on several
parameters, e.g. the latitude of the observatory, the position of the
target on the sky, and the exposure time. We show that there are
realistic observing scenarios, where the errors can amount to more than
1 m s-1. We therefore recommend that instruments operating in
this regime always record and store the exposure meter flux curve (or a
similar measure) to be used as photon-weights for the barycentric
correction. In existing data, if the flux curve is no longer available,
we argue that second-order errors in the barycentric correction can be
mitigated by adding a correction term assuming constant flux.},

In this bank of RVs, we identify a sample of RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is {\textless}10 m s-1, and use them to reveal two small but significant nightly zero-point effects: a
discontinuous jump, caused by major modifications of the instrument in August 2004, and a long-term drift. The size of the 2004 jump is 1.5 ± 0.1 m s-1, and the slow zero-point variations have a typical magnitude of ≲ 1 m s-1. In addition, we find a small but significant correlation between stellar RVs and the time relative to local midnight, indicative of an average intra-night drift of 0.051 ± 0.004 m s-1 h-1. We correct the 64 480 HIRES RVs for the systematic effects we find, and make the corrected RVs publicly available. Our findings demonstrate the

The five-parameter astrometric solution - positions on the sky
(alpha,delta), parallaxes, and proper motions - for more than 1.3 billion (109) sources, with a limiting magnitude of G=21 and a bright limit of G{\textasciitilde}=3. Parallax uncertainties are in the range of up to 0.04 milliarcsecond for sources at G{\textless}15, around 0.1mas for sources with G=17 and at the faint end, the uncertainty is of the order of 0.7mas at G=20. The corresponding uncertainties in the respective proper motion components are up to 0.06mas/yr (for G{\textless}15mag), 0.2mas/yr (for G=17mag) and 1.2mas/yr (for G=20mag). The Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions are based only on Gaia data; they do no longer depend on the Tycho-2 Catalogue.

Median radial velocities (i.e. the median value over the epochs) for more than 6 million stars with a mean G magnitude between about 4 and 13 and an effective temperature (Teff) in the range of about 3550 to 6900K. This leads to a full six-parameter solution: positions and motions on the sky with parallaxes and radial velocities, all combined with mean G magnitudes. The overall precision of the radial velocities at the bright end is in the order of 200-300m/s while at the faint end the overall precision is approximately 1.2km/s for a Teff of 4750K and about 2.5km/s for a Teff of 6500K.

An additional set of more than 200 million sources for which a
two-parameter solution is available: the positions on the sky
(alpha,delta) combined with the mean G magnitude. These sources will have a positional uncertainty at G=20 of about 2mas, at J2015.5.

G magnitudes for more than 1.5 billion sources, with precisions varying from around 1 milli-mag at the bright (G{\textless}13) end to around 20
milli-mag at G=20. Please be aware that the photometric system for the G band in Gaia DR2 will be different from the photometric system as used in Gaia DR1.

GBP and GRP magnitudes for more than 1.1 billion sources, with precisions varying from a few milli-mag at the bright (G{\textless}13) end to around 200 milli-mag at G=20. Full passband definitions for G, BP and RP. These passbands are now available for download. A detailed description is given here. Epoch astrometry for more than 13,000 known asteroids based on more than 1.5 million CCD observations. 96\% of the along-scan (AL) residuals are in the range -5 to 5mas, and 52\% of the AL residuals are in the range of -1 to 1mas. The observations will be published in Gaia DR2 and also delivered to the Minor Planet Center (MPC).

Subject to limitations the effective temperatures Teff for more than 150 million sources brighter than 17th magnitude with effective temperatures in the range 3000 to 10,000 K. For a subset of these sources also the line-of-sight extinction AG and reddening E(BP-RP) will be given, as well as the luminosity and radius.

	abstract = {Context. Data from complex modern astronomical instruments often consist of a large number of different science and calibration files, and their reduction requires a variety of software tools. The execution chain of the tools represents a complex workflow that needs to be tuned and supervised, often by individual researchers that are not necessarily experts for any specific instrument. Aims: The efficiency of data reduction can be improved by using automatic workflows to organise data and execute a sequence of data reduction steps. To realize such
efficiency gains, we designed a system that allows intuitive
representation, execution and modification of the data reduction workflow, and has facilities for inspection and interaction with the data. Methods: The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has developed Reflex, an environment to automate data reduction workflows. Reflex is implemented as a package of customized components for the Kepler workflow engine. Kepler provides the graphical user interface to create an executable flowchart-like representation of the data reduction process. Key features of Reflex are a rule-based data organiser, infrastructure to re-use results, thorough book-keeping, data progeny tracking, interactive user interfaces, and a novel concept to exploit information created during data organisation for the workflow execution. Results: Automated workflows can greatly increase the efficiency of astronomical data reduction. In Reflex, workflows can be run
non-interactively as a first step. Subsequent optimization can then be carried out while transparently re-using all unchanged intermediate products. We found that such workflows enable the reduction of complex data by non-expert users and minimizes mistakes due to book-keeping errors. Conclusions: Reflex includes novel concepts to increase the efficiency of astronomical data processing. While Reflex is a specific implementation of astronomical scientific workflows within the Kepler workflow engine, the overall design choices and methods can also be applied to other environments for running automated science
workflows.},

	abstract = {Context. Stellar activity is the main limitation to the detection of an 
Earth-twin using the radial-velocity (RV) technique. Despite many
efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of stellar activity using
empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we are facing an
obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using current
techniques. Aims: In this paper, we investigate a novel approach
to derive precise RVs considering the wealth of information present in
high-resolution spectra. Methods: This new method consists of
building a master spectrum from all available observations and measure
the RVs of each individual spectral line in a spectrum relative to this
master. When analysing several spectra, the final product of this
approach is the RVs of each individual line as a function of time. Results: We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed with
HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the
one derived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to
derive RVs demonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength
solution induces night-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of
0.4 m s-1, and we propose a solution to correct for this
systematic. Finally, and this is probably the most astrophysically
relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some spectral lines
are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not. By
measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines,
we demonstrate that we can boost by a factor of two or mitigate by a
factor of 1.6 the red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RV
measurements of α Cen B. Conclusions: By measuring the RVs
of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV precision as
other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows us to
demonstrate that each spectral line is differently affected by stellar
activity. Preliminary results show that studying in details the
behaviour of each spectral line is probably the key to overcome the
obstacle of stellar activity.

	abstract = {Cool main-sequence, subgiant, and red giant stars all show solar-like 
oscillations, pulsations that are excited and intrinsically damped by
near-surface convection. Many overtones are typically excited to
observable amplitudes, giving a rich spectrum of detectable modes. These
modes provide a wealth of information on fundamental stellar properties.
However, the radial velocity (RV) shifts induced by these oscillations
can also be problematic when searching for low-mass, long-period
planets; this is because their amplitudes are large enough to completely
mask such minute planetary signals. Here we show how fine-tuning
exposure times to the stellar parameters can help efficiently average
out the solar-like, oscillation-induced shifts. To reduce the
oscillation signal to the RV precision commensurate with an Earth
analog, we find that for cool, low-mass stars (near spectral type K),
the necessary exposure times may be as short as ∼4 minutes, while
for hotter, higher-mass stars (near spectral type F, or slightly
evolved), the required exposure times can be longer than 100 minutes. We
provide guideline exposure durations required to suppress the total
observed amplitude due to oscillations to a level of 0.1 m
s-1, and a level corresponding to the Earth-analog reflex
amplitude for the star. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic variability of
the oscillations, we recommend in practice choosing short exposure
durations at the telescope and then averaging over those exposures
later, as guided by our predictions. To summarize, as we enter an era of
0.1 m s-1 instrumental precision, it is critical to tailor
our observing strategies to the stellar properties.},

Jupiter-like and lower-mass planets. We describe a technique which yields relative radial velocity errors of 3 m s{\textasciicircum}-1. This technique makes use of a fast echelle spectrograph at resolution of R=62,000 and a large format CCD which acquires the entire visible and near IR spectrum in each exposure. Starlight is sent through an iodine absorption cell placed at the spectrometer entrance slit. The resulting superimposed iodine lines provide a fiducial wavelength scale against which to measure radial velocity shifts. The shapes of iodine lines convey the PSF of the spectrometer to account for changes in spectrometer optics and illumination on all times scales. We construct a model of each observed spectrum by multiplying a stellar spectrum with an iodine spectrum and convolving the result with the spectrometer PSF. The free parameters of the model include the wavelength scale, spectrometer PSF, and stellar Doppler shift. All model parameters are derived anew for each exposure and the synthesis is done on a grid of CCD sub-pixels, using spline functions as interpolation predictors. We present Doppler tests of the Sun, Tau Ceti, and 107 Psc, observed with the Lick and Keck echelles. All exhibit apparent errors of about 3 m s{\textasciicircum}-1, maintained on time scales of minutes to a year.

	abstract = {Orbiting a bright, nearby star the 55 Cnc system offers a rare opportunity to study a multiplanet system that has a wide range of planetary masses and orbital distances. Using two decades of photometry and spectroscopy data, we have measured the rotation of the host star and its solar-like magnetic cycle. Accounting for this cycle in our velocimetric analysis of the system allows us to revise the properties of the outermost giant planet and its four planetary companions. The innermost planet 55 Cnc e is an unusually close-in super-Earth, whose transits have allowed for detailed follow-up studies. Recent observations favor the presence of a substantial atmosphere yet its composition, and the nature of the planet, remain unknown. We combined our derived planet mass ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}p{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 8.0 ± 0.3 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) with refined measurement of its optical radius derived from HST/STIS observations ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}p{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 1.88 ± 0.03 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} over 530–750 nm) to revise the density of 55 Cnc e ({\textless}i{\textgreater}ρ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 6.7 ± 0.4 g cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}). Based on these revised properties we have characterized possible interiors of 55 Cnc e using a generalized Bayesian model. We confirm that the planet is likely surrounded by a heavyweight atmosphere, contributing a few percents of the planet radius. While we cannot exclude the presence of a water layer underneath the atmosphere, this scenario is unlikely given the observations of the planet across the entire spectrum and its strong irradiation. Follow-up observations of the system in photometry and in spectroscopy over different time-scales are needed to further investigate the nature and origin of this iconic super-Earth.},

	abstract = {In recent years, dedicated extreme precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs have produced vast quantities of high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise (S/N) time-series spectra for bright stars. These data contain valuable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured RVs and stellar characterization via the coadded spectra. However, considerable data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products from the observed spectra at the highest possible precision, including the issue of poorly characterized telluric absorption features and the common use of an assumed stellar spectral template. In both of these examples, precision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using the data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using a linear model (in the log of flux). The model employs a convex objective and convex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast. We implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package that uses TensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network applications to astronomical data. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV evolution of the M dwarf Barnard’s Star, and retrieve the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The method additionally produces extremely high-S/N composite stellar spectra and detailed time-variable telluric spectra, which we also present here.},

	abstract = {The next generation of exoplanet-hunting spectrographs should deliver up to an order of magnitude improvement in radial velocity (RV) precision over the standard 1 state-of-the-art spectrographs. This advance is critical for enabling the detection of Earth-mass planets around Sun-like stars. New calibration techniques such as laser frequency combs and stabilized etalons ensure that the instrumental stability is well characterized. However, additional sources of error include stellar noise, undetected short-period planets, and telluric contamination. To understand and ultimately mitigate error sources, the contributing terms in the error budget must be isolated to the greatest extent possible. Here, we introduce a new high-cadence RV program, the Extreme Precision Spectrograph (EXPRES) 100 Earths Survey, which aims to identify rocky planets around bright, nearby G and K dwarfs. We also present a benchmark case: the 62 day orbit of a Saturn-mass planet orbiting the chromospherically quiet star, HD 3651. The combination of high eccentricity (0.6) and a moderately long orbital period ensures significant dynamical clearing of any inner planets. Our Keplerian model for this planetary orbit has a residual rms of 58 cm s−1 over a ∼6 month time baseline. By eliminating significant contributors to the RV error budget, HD 3651 serves as a standard for evaluating the long-term precision of extreme precision RV programs.},

We present the most precise planet size distribution to date based on Gaia parallaxes, Kepler photometry, and spectroscopic temperatures from the California-Kepler Survey. Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11\% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the errors are now 3\%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5\% precision. With a catalog of ∼1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a planet’s orbital distance and its host-star mass, both of which are related to a planet’s X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower-mass stars, the bimodal planet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars producing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the extent of the “sub-Neptune desert” and the width and slope of the gap support the view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant evolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution.},

	abstract = {The discovery of exoplanets, planets outside of the solar system, has revolutionized astronomy. It has upended our understanding of planet formation and the architecture of planetary systems. Thousands of planets have been discovered to date, the majority of which have been found using data from the Kepler space telescope using the transit technique, which is when the planet transits in front of its host star from the viewpoint of Earth. Current computer algorithms have been highly successful at discovering planets, but they are not fully complete. In this thesis, I search for hidden planets in the Kepler field.
In Chapter 2, I report the discovery of 14 new transiting planet candidates in the Kepler field from the Planet Hunters citizen science program. The new candidates have periods ranging from 121–904 days, eight residing in their host star's habitable zone (HZ) and two (now) in multiple planet systems. I also report the discovery of a seventh planet candidate orbiting KOI-351 (Kepler-90), marking the first and only seven planet candidate system yet discovered outside of our solar system. K01-351 bears some resemblance to a compact version of our own solar system, with the inner five planets ranging from Earth to mini-Neptune radii and the outer planets being gas giants, all of them orbiting [special characters omitted] 1 AU from their host star.
In Chapter 3, I report the discovery of one new confirmed planet ( P = 66.06 days, Rp = 2.68±0.17R ⊕ ) and mass determinations of two previously validated Kepler planets, Kepler-289 b (P = 34.55 days, Rp = 2.15±0.10R⊕) and Kepler-289-c (P = 125.85 days, Rp = 11.59 ± 0.10 R⊕), through their transit timing variations caused by gravitational interactions between the planets. The masses of the inner, middle, and outer planets are measured to be M = 7.3 ± 6.8M⊕, 4.0 ± 0.9M ⊕, and M = 131.5 ± 17.0M ⊕, which I designate PH3 b, c, and d, respectively. The middle planet, PH3 c, has a relatively low density, p = 1.2 ± 0.3 g/cm3 for a planet of its mass, requiring a substantial H/He atmosphere of {\textasciitilde}3\%. It joins the growing population of low-mass, low-density planets, which may help constrain models planetary formation and migration.
In Chapter 4, I present 10 new planet candidates from the extended Kepler mission, K2, and perform high-resolution observations on 75 targets from K2 Campaigns 1-3 using speckle interferometry and adaptive optics imaging. This sample includes 37 stars likely to host planets, 32 targets likely to be eclipsing binaries (EBs), and 6 other targets previously labeled as likely planetary false positives. Six of the nine detected companions are new discoveries. One of the six, EPIC 206061524, is associated with a planet candidate.
In Chapter 5, I examine a sample of 114 stars with 3+ confirmed planets to search for hidden planets due to the Kepler pipeline's "Swiss cheesing" of the light curve. In the pipeline, after a transit signal is found, all data points associated with those transits are removed, creating a "Swiss cheese"-like light curve full of holes, which is then used for subsequent transit searches. A simulation determined that the probability that a transiting planet is lost due to the transit masking is low, but non-neglible, reaching a plateau at {\textasciitilde} 3.3\% lost in the period range of P = 400 – 500 days. We then model the transits in all quarters of each star and subtract out the transit signals, restoring the in-transit data points, and use the Kepler pipeline to search the transit-subtracted (i.e., transit-cleaned) light curves. However, the pipeline did not discover any credible new transit signals. This demonstrates the validity and robustness of the Kepler pipeline's choice to use transit masking over transit subtraction. However, a follow-up visual search through all the transit-subtracted data, which allows for easier visual identification of new transits, reveiled the existence of a new, Neptune-sized exoplanet that transited twice in the Kepler data. Kepler-150 f ( P = 637.2 days, Rp = 3.64+0.52 -0.39 R⊕ is confirmed with {\textgreater} 99.998\% confidence using a combination of the planet multiplicity argument, a false positive probability analysis, and a transit duration analysis.
These new discoveries add to the ever-growing inventory of exoplanets. Much of this work was completed through the citizen science program Planet Hunters, which not only drives public interest in astronomy, but has led to useful scientific discoveries. The two confirmed planets allow for better analyses of exoplanet population statistics, while the long-period planet candidates provide much needed numbers in a sparsely populated region of exoplanet parameter space. Greater discoveries are on the horizon. Future discoveries will require strong support, both publicly and financially, of continued astronomical research.},

	abstract = {Improvements in radial velocity precision and detection capabilities will one day lead to the detection of earth-mass planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Detecting low mass planets at large separations will help fill in our understanding of how planetary systems form and subsequently evolve. Additionally, they will provide a target list for followup with future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope that will search for atmospheric biosignatures and help determine how common life is in the universe. This thesis presents observations, methods, and analyses created to improve the instrumental precision, efficiency, and detection capabilities of the radial velocity (RV) method of exoplanet detection.
Chapters 2 and 3 present 7 planetary systems discovered using the HIRES Spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. One of these systems presents a challenge for theorists, as it cannot be explained with current planet formation and migration theories. We also detect a correlation between RV measurements and S-value measurements, which are an indicator of stellar activity. By linearly modeling and removing this correlation, the residual RMS of the velocities improved by 21\%.
In Chapters 4 and 5 we describe the commissioning and software stack behind CHIRON, a new instrument we commissioned on a 1.5 m telescope at the CTIO Observatory. CHIRON provides a queue-based observing system for the general astronomical community, and dealing manually with the large amount of data collected nightly quickly became an overwhelming task. Primarily to reduce time and error, most of the observing pipeline for CHIRON was automated, which is described in these two chapters.
Lastly, we present observations from a multi-facility campaign to simultaneously observe the young and moderately active K dwarf e Eridani. We use this data to explore three methods of modeling stellar activity: spot modeling, the FF' method, and a new approach that makes use of Ha measurements input into the FF' method, which we refer to as the HH' method. Spot modeling yielded the best result of the three methods tested in terms of residual RMS after subtracting the model from the data, and reduced the RMS from 7.4 m s -1 to 2.7 m s-1. However, the HH' method benefits from not needing precise space-based photometry as input. Additionally, the HH' method only makes use of one of the thousands of lines in the visible spectrum; incorporating more spectral lines into the model would most likely lead to significant improvements.},

	abstract = {To discover Earth analogs around other stars, next generation spectrographs must measure radial velocity with 10 cm s−1 precision. Since even microtellurics can induce RV errors of up to 50 cm s−1, achieving 10 cm s−1 precision requires precise modeling of telluric absorption features. The standard approaches to telluric modeling are (a) observing a standard star and (b) using a radiative transfer code. Observing standard stars, however, takes valuable observing time away from science targets. Radiative transfer codes, meanwhile, may omit microtelluric features, which are an important contributor to the RV error budget at 10 cm s−1. To address these issues, we present a telluric model of the self-calibrating, empirical, light-weight linear regression telluric (SELENITE) model for high-resolution spectra. The model exploits two simple observations: (a) water tellurics grow proportionally to precipitable water vapor and therefore proportionally to each other and (b) non-water tellurics grow proportionally to airmass. Water tellurics can be identified by looking for pixels whose growth correlates with a known calibration water telluric and modeled by regression against it, and likewise non-water tellurics with airmass. The model does not require line data, water vapor measurements, or additional observations (beyond one-time calibration observations), achieves fits with a of 1.17 on B stars and 2.95 on K dwarfs, and leaves residuals of 1\% (B stars) and 1.1\% (K dwarfs) of continuum. Fitting takes seconds on laptop PCs; SELENITE is light-weight enough to guide observing runs.},

We report on extensive laboratory testing and on-sky observations to quantitatively assess the instrumental radial-velocity measurement precision of EXPRES, with a focused discussion of individual terms in the instrument error budget. We find that EXPRES can reach a single-measurement instrument calibration precision better than 10 cm s−1, not including photon noise from stellar observations. We also report on the performance of the various environmental, mechanical, and optical subsystems of EXPRES, assessing any contributions to radial-velocity error. For atmospheric and telescope related effects, this includes the fast tip-tilt guiding system, atmospheric dispersion compensation, and the chromatic exposure meter. For instrument calibration, this includes the laser fRequency comb (LFC), flat-field light source, CCD detector, and effects in the optical fibers. Modal noise is mitigated to a negligible level via a chaotic fiber agitator, which is especially important for wavelength calibration with the LFC. Regarding detector effects, we empirically assess the impact on the radial-velocity precision due to pixel-position nonuniformities and charge transfer inefficiency (CTI). EXPRES has begun its science survey to discover exoplanets orbiting G-dwarf and K-dwarf stars, in addition to transit spectroscopy and measurements of the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric effects on stellar radial velocity measurements for exoplanet discovery and characterization have not yet been fully investigated for extreme precision levels. We carry out calculations to determine the wavelength dependence of barycentric corrections across optical wavelengths, due to the ubiquitous variations in air mass during observations. We demonstrate that radial velocity errors of at least several cm s−1 can be incurred if the wavelength dependence is not included in the photon-weighted barycentric corrections. A minimum of four wavelength channels across optical spectra (380–680 nm) are required to account for this effect at the 10 cm s−1 level, with polynomial fits of the barycentric corrections applied to cover all wavelengths. Additional channels may be required in poor observing conditions or to avoid strong telluric absorption features. Furthermore, consistent flux sampling on the order of seconds throughout the observation is necessary to ensure that accurate photon weights are obtained. Finally, we describe how a multiple-channel exposure meter will be implemented in the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES).},

However, in the presence of deep spectral lines, a high-order polynomial fit can result in ripples in the normalized continuum that increase errors in spectral analysis. Here, we present two algorithms for flattening the spectrum continuum. The Alpha-shape Fitting to Spectrum algorithm is completely data driven, using an alpha shape to obtain an initial estimate of the blaze function. The Alpha-shape and Lab Source Fitting to Spectrum algorithm incorporates a continuum constraint from a laboratory source reference spectrum for the blaze function estimation. These algorithms are tested on a simulated spectrum, where we demonstrate improved normalization compared to polynomial regression for continuum fitting. We show an additional application, using the algorithms for mitigation of spatially correlated quantum efficiency variations and fringing in the charge-coupled device detector of the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer.},

The spectra are extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS), and the RVs are computed by cross-correlating with a numerical mask.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This study has three main aims: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply the new public SpEctrum Radial Velocity AnaLyser (SERVAL) pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV data set. (iii) Determine whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved by correcting for small nightly systematic effects.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} For each star observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. This was based on fitting each observed spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio template created by coadding all the available spectra of that star. We then computed nightly zero-points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} By analyzing the RVs of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is {\textless} 5 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, we find that SERVAL RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. By investigating the NZP time series, we find three significant systematic effects whose magnitude is independent of the software that is used to derive the RV: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of ∼1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of ∼1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and a typical timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20–30 NZPs that significantly deviate by a few m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. In addition, we find small (≲1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}) but significant intra-night drifts in DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump that strongly depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from ∼14 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for late F-type stars to ∼ − 3 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for M dwarfs. The combined effect of extracting the RVs with SERVAL and correcting them for the systematics we find is an improved average RV precision: an improvement of ∼5\% for spectra taken before the 2015 intervention, and an improvement of ∼15\% for spectra taken after it. To demonstrate the quality of the new RV data set, we present an updated orbital solution of the GJ 253 two-planet system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be retrieved from a user-friendly public database. It provides more than 212 000 RVs for about 3000 stars along with much auxiliary information, such as the NZP corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.},

In addition to instrumental innovations, the EXPRES pipeline, presented here, is the first on-sky, optical, fiber-fed spectrograph to employ many novel techniques—including an “extended flat” fiber used for wavelength-dependent quantum efficiency characterization of the CCD, a flat-relative optimal extraction algorithm, chromatic barycentric corrections, chromatic calibration offsets, and an ultra-precise laser frequency comb for wavelength calibration. We describe the reduction, calibration, and RV analysis pipeline used for EXPRES and present an example of our current sub-meter-per-second RV measurement precision, which reaches a formal, single-measurement error of 0.3 m s−1 for an observation with a per-pixel signal-to-noise ratio of 250.

	abstract = {Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics; these measurements provide access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitate the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling distributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient searches for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M-dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra.

	abstract = {Silicon photonics has offered a versatile platform for the recent development of integrated optomechanical circuits. However, silicon is limited to wavelengths above 1.1 μm and does not allow device operation in the visible spectrum range where low-noise lasers are conveniently available. The narrow bandgap of silicon also makes silicon optomechanical devices susceptible to strong two-photon absorption and free carrier absorption, which often introduce strong thermal effects that limit the devices' stability and cooling performance. Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order optical nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components on a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide-band semiconductor widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its low mechanical loss and high electromechanical coupling strength. In this paper, we report the development of AlN-on-silicon platform for low loss, wide-band optical guiding, as well as its use for achieving simultaneously high-optical-quality-factor and high-mechanical-quality-factor optomechanical devices. Exploiting AlN's inherent second-order nonlinearity we further demonstrate electro-optic modulation and efficient second harmonic generation in AlN photonic circuits. Our results suggest that low-cost AlN-on-silicon photonic circuits are excellent substitutes for complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor-compatible photonic circuits for building new functional optomechanical devices that are free from carrier effects.},

The output is phase-coherent over a 1-2 μm octave-spanning spectrum with a pulse repetition rate of ∼200 MHz and a residual pulse-to-pulse timing jitter {\textless}3 fs well within the requirements of most frequency-comb applications. Digital control enables phase coherent operation for over 90 h, critical for phase-sensitive applications such as timekeeping. We show that this phase-slip free operation follows the fundamental limit set by the SNR of the control signals. Performance metrics from three nearly identical combs are presented.

Here, we present experimental measurements of the noise distributions for both full- and restricted-mode launch cases and show that the noise statistics for a restricted launch are significantly different than for a full-mode launch. In particular, the variance of the noise distribution is larger than in the over-filled launch case leading to a degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Modifications of existing theory are then used to develop a numerical model for the noise statistics of a restricted-mode launch and good agreement between this model and experimental data is achieved.},

	abstract = {Context. Searching for extrasolar planets through radial velocity measurements relies on the stability of stellar photospheres. Aims. We aim at characterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and studying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities, line bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS high-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over about 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H\&K chromospheric activity measurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration taking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a function of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities and line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the magnitude and timescale of the Ca II H\&K variability, and identify activity cycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8\% of old solar-type stars in the solar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones), while 61+/-8\% do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G dwarfs and at mean activity levels log R'HK {\textless} -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude generally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of stars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters that are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities to magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are almost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period, low-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to {\textasciitilde}25 m/s. Caution is therefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets. However, these effects can be corrected to high precision by detrending the radial velocity data using simultaneous measurements of Ca II H\&K flux and line shape parameters. (Abridged)},

Confocal microscopy is an important tool for biomedical imaging since it improves image quality by rejecting background signals. However, it suffers from low sensitivity in deep tissues due to light scattering. Recently, multimode fibers have provided a new paradigm for minimally invasive endoscopic imaging by controlling light propagation through them. Here we introduce a combined imaging technique where confocal images are acquired through a multimode fiber. We achieve this by digitally engineering the excitation wavefront and then applying a virtual digital pinhole on the collected signal. In this way, we are able to acquire images through the fiber with significantly increased contrast. With a fiber of numerical aperture 0.22, we achieve a lateral resolution of 1.5\&\#x00B5;m, and an axial resolution of 12.7\&\#x00B5;m.

The primary factors affecting the spectral resolution and throughput of an optical spectrometer are the size of the entrance aperture and the optical power of the focusing element. So far, the collective optimization of the above mentioned has proven difficult. Here, we introduce the concept of high-throughput computational slits (HTCS), a numerical technique for improving both the effective spectral resolution and efficiency of a spectrometer. The proposed HTCS approach was experimentally validated using an optical spectrometer configured with a 200 μm entrance aperture, test, and a 50 μm entrance aperture control, demonstrating improvements in the spectral resolution of the spectrum by ∼50\% over the control spectral resolution and improvements in efficiency of \&gt;2 times over the efficiency of the largest entrance aperture used in this Letter, while producing highly accurate spectra.},

	abstract = {High-resolution spectrographs extract detailed spectral information of a sample and are frequently used in astronomy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. These instruments employ dispersive elements such as prisms and diffraction gratings to spatially separate different wavelengths of light, which are then detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detector array. Precise alignment along the optical axis (focus position) of the detector array is critical to maximize the instrumental resolution; however, traditional approaches of scanning the detector through focus lack a quantitative measure of precision, limiting the repeatability and relying on one\&\#x2019;s experience. Here we propose a method to evaluate the focus alignment of spectrograph detector arrays by establishing confidence intervals to measure the alignment precision. We show that propagation of uncertainty can be used to estimate the variance in an alignment, thus providing a quantitative and repeatable means to evaluate the precision and confidence of an alignment. We test the approach by aligning the detector array of a prototype miniature echelle spectrograph. The results indicate that the procedure effectively quantifies alignment precision, enabling one to objectively determine when an alignment has reached an acceptable level. This quantitative approach also provides a foundation for further optimization, including automated alignment. Furthermore, the procedure introduced here can be extended to other alignment techniques that rely on numerically fitting data to a model, providing a general framework for evaluating the precision of alignment methods.},

For the double scrambler test data, we further reduced the radial velocity scatter from an average of ∼2:1 ms?1 to ∼1:5 ms?1 after adopting a median description of the stabilized SLSF in our Doppler model. This demonstrates that inaccuracies in modeling the SLSF contribute to the velocity rms. Imperfect knowledge of the SLSF, rather than stellar jitter, sets the precision floor for chromospherically quiet stars analyzed with the iodine technique using Keck HIRES and other slit-fed spectrometers. It is increasingly common practice for astronomers to scale stellar noise in quadrature with formal errors such that their Keplerian model yields a χ2 fit of 1.0. When this is done, errors from inaccurate modeling of the SLSF (and perhaps from other sources) are attributed to the star, and the floor of the stellar noise is overestimated.},

This noise source can limit the signal-to-noise ratio and jeopardize photon-noise limited data. The subject of the present work is to compare measurements of modal noise and focal-ratio degradation (FRD) for several commonly-used fibres. We study the influence of a simple mechanical scrambling method (excenter) on both FRD and modal noise. Measurements are performed with circular and octagonal fibres from Polymicro Technology (FBP-Series) with diameters of 100, 200 and 300 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m and for square and rectangular fibres from CeramOptec, among others. FRD measurements for the same sample of fibres are performed as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, we replaced the circular fibre of the STELLA-echelle-spectrograph (SES) in Tenerife with an octagonal and found a SNR increase by a factor of 1.6 at 678 nm. It is shown in the laboratory that an excenter with a large amplitude and low frequency will not influence the FRD but will reduce modal noise rather effectively by up to 180\%.},

We investigate the effect of the fiber geometry on the spectral resolution and bandwidth, and also discuss the additional limitation on the bandwidth imposed by speckle contrast reduction when measuring dense spectra. Finally, we demonstrate a method to reduce the spectrum reconstruction error and increase the bandwidth by separately imaging the speckle patterns of orthogonal polarizations.

The author has attempted to choose the fibres most suitable for astronomy and to measure the properties of those fibres relevant to their use with astronomical instruments.},

We have collected the first on-sky performance and modal noise tests of these novel fibers in the near-infrared at H and K bands using the CSHELL spectrograph at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF). We discuss the design behind our novel reverse injection of a red laser for co-alignment of star-light with the fiber tip via a corner cube and visible camera. We summarize the practical details involved in the construction of the fiber scrambler, and the mechanical agitation of the fiber at the telescope. We present radial velocity measurements of a bright standard star taken with and without the fiber scrambler to quantify the relative improvement in the obtainable blaze function stability, the line spread function stability, and the resulting radial velocity precision. We assess the feasibility of applying this illumination stabilization technique to the next generation of near-infrared spectrographs such as iSHELL on IRTF and an upgraded NIRSPEC at Keck. Our results may also be applied in the visible for smaller core diameter fibers where fiber modal noise is a significant factor, such as behind an adaptive optics system or on a small {\textless} 1 meter class telescope such as is being pursued by the MINERVA and LCOGT collaborations},

	abstract = {ESPRESSO, the VLT rocky exoplanets hunter, will combine the efficiency of modern echelle spectrograph with extreme radial-velocity precision. It will be installed at Paranal on ESO's VLT in order to achieve a gain of two magnitudes with respect to its predecessor HARPS, and the instrumental radial-velocity precision will be improved to reach 10 cm/s level. We have constituted a Consortium of astronomical research institutes to fund, design and build ESPRESSO on behalf of and in collaboration with ESO, the European Southern Observatory. The project has passed the preliminary design review in November 2011. The spectrograph will be installed at the so-called "Combined Coudé Laboratory" of the VLT, it will be linked to the four 8.2 meters Unit Telescopes (UT) through four optical "Coudé trains" and will be operated either with a single telescope or with up to four UTs. In exchange of the major financial and human effort the building Consortium will be awarded with guaranteed observing time (GTO), which will be invested in a common scientific program. Thanks to its characteristics and the ability of combining incoherently the light of 4 large telescopes, ESPRESSO will offer new possibilities in many fields of astronomy. Our main scientific objectives are, however, the search and characterization of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zone of quiet, near-by G to M-dwarfs, and the analysis of the variability of fundamental physical constants. In this paper, we present the ambitious scientific objectives, the capabilities of ESPRESSO, the technical solutions for the system and its subsystems, enlightening the main differences between ESPRESSO and its predecessors.

	abstract = {Modal noise in optical fibers imposes limits on the signal to noise and velocity precision achievable with the next generation of astronomical spectrographs. This is an increasingly pressing problem for precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs in the near-infrared (NIR) and optical that require both high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise. Many of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission line calibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot etalons to achieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high precision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent sources. Coupling light from single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads to only a very low number of modes being excited, thereby exacerbating the modal noise measured by the spectrograph. We present a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that significantly mitigates modal noise at all optical and NIR wavelengths, and which can be applied to spectrograph calibration systems. Our solution uses an integrating sphere in conjunction with a diffuser that is moved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally superior to most tested forms of mechanical fiber agitation. We demonstrate a high level of modal noise reduction with a narrow bandwidth 1550 nm laser. Our relatively inexpensive solution immediately enables spectrographs to take advantage of the innate precision of bright state-of-the art calibration sources by removing a major source of systematic noise.},

A solution to this problem - a prototype double scrambler using two fibers coupled by an afocal lens system - is characterized. With the double scrambler, intensity variations across the near- and far-field patterns due to both angular and positional changes in the input beam are reduced by factors ranging from 2 to 10. In all cases, relative variations across the images are reduced to or below the 1-percent level.

In controlled laboratory experiments at a resolution of ∼150,000, we found S/N limited to ≤500 for a range of fiber perturbations and illumination geometries from simple displacement to simulated seeing variations. We find an empirical relation between the number of monochromatic modes and the level of modal noise for which we offer no rigorous explanation.

	abstract = {Optical fiber modal noise is a limiting factor for high precision spectroscopy signal-to-noise in the near-infrared and visible. Unabated, especially when using highly coherent light sources for wavelength calibration, modal noise can induce radial velocity (RV) errors that hinder the discovery of low-mass (and potentially Earth-like) planets. Previous research in this field has found sufficient modal noise mitigation through the use of an integrating sphere, but this requires extremely bright light sources, a luxury not necessarily afforded by the next generation of high-resolution optical spectrographs. Otherwise, mechanical agitation, which “mixes” the fiber’s modal patterns and allows the noise to be averaged over minutes-long exposures, provides some noise reduction but the exact mechanism behind improvement in signal-to-noise and RV drift has not been fully explored or optimized by the community. Therefore, we have filled out the parameter space of modal noise agitation techniques in order to better understand agitation’s contribution to mitigating modal noise and to discover a better method for agitating fibers. We find that modal noise is best suppressed by the quasi-chaotic motion of two high-amplitude agitators oscillating with varying phase for fibers with large core diameters and low azimuthal symmetry. This work has subsequently influenced the design of a fiber agitator, to be installed with the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph, that we estimate will reduce modal-noise-induced RV error to less than 3.2 cm s−1.},

	abstract = {Supercontinuum generation using chip-integrated photonic waveguides is a powerful approach for spectrally broadening pulsed laser sources with very low pulse energies and compact form factors. When pumped with a mode-locked laser frequency comb, these waveguides can coherently expand the comb spectrum to more than an octave in bandwidth to enable self-referenced stabilization. However, for applications in frequency metrology and precision spectroscopy, it is desirable to not only support self-referencing, but also to generate low-noise combs with customizable broadband spectra. In this work, we demonstrate dispersion-engineered waveguides based on silicon nitride that are designed to meet these goals and enable precision optical metrology experiments across large wavelength spans. We perform a clock comparison measurement and report a clock-limited relative frequency instability of \$3.8{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at \${\textbackslash}tau = 2\$ seconds between a 1550 nm cavity-stabilized reference laser and NIST's calcium atomic clock laser at 657 nm using a two-octave waveguide-supercontinuum comb.},

Periodic electro-optic modulation (EOM) transforms the CW laser into a continuous train of picosecond optical pulses. Subsequent nonlinear-fiber broadening of this EOM frequency comb produces a supercontinuum with 160 THz of bandwidth. A critical intermediate step is optical filtering of the EOM comb to reduce electronic-noise-induced decoherence of the supercontinuum. Applying f-2f self-referencing with the supercontinuum yields the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the EOM comb, which is precisely the difference of the CW laser frequency and an exact integer multiple of the EOM pulse repetition rate. Here we demonstrate absolute optical frequency metrology and synthesis applications of the self-referenced CW laser with {\textless}5E-14 fractional accuracy and stability.},

The algorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2D point-spread functions (PSFs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which is only correct for a limited class of separable PSFs. The algorithm results in statistically independent extracted samples in the 1D spectrum, and preserves the full native resolution of the 2D spectrograph without degradation. Both the statistical errors and the 1D resolution of the extracted spectrum are accurately determined, allowing a correct chi-squared comparison of any model spectrum with the data. Using a model PSF similar to that found in the red channel of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrograph, we compare the performance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction, and also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foreground estimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. This work demonstrates the feasibility of current- and next-generation multi-fiber spectrographs for faint galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-sky foregrounds. We describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fiber crosstalk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to the analysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could be generalized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination of astronomical imaging data.},

	abstract = {We present a method for measuring the degree of focal ratio degradation (FRD) of an optical fibre and characterizing its performance by a single parameter, which can be used to model accurately the fibre's FRD performance in most astronomical spectroscopic applications. By using a known theoretical model for microbending-induced beamspreading, we have modelled the far-field output of an optical fibre for various input beams including collimated beams, uncollimated input beam and uncollimated pencil beams tilted with respect to the fibre's optical axis. This theory characterizes the FRD with a single paramter \$D\$. We have tested the validity of our model by observing the far-field output of a fibre in the laboratory and comparing it with the model's preidicitons. For the case of a collimated input beam (a laser beam), we measured the beamspreading as a function of the input beam angle and etermined the parameter \$D\$ by finding the best fit to the data. By using this value of \$D\$, we successfully predict the results of other experiments where the far-field output beam is recorded for input pencil beams of varying \$f\$-ratio. We therefore propose that the complete FRD performance of any fibre can be accurately predicted using a theoretical model and the appropriate value of \$D\$, which can be determined by a simple experiment. Finally, we suggest that the use of a single parameter to describe FRD will allow workers in the field to compare the performances of various fibres in a simple, well-defined way.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art Doppler experiments require wavelength calibration with precision at the cm/s level. A low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) can provide a wavelength comb with a very large bandwidth as required for astronomical experiments, but unavoidable spectral drifts are difficult to control. Instead of actively controlling the FPI cavity, we propose to passively stabilize the interferometer and track the time-dependent cavity length drift externally. A dual-finesse cavity allows drift tracking during observation. The drift of the cavity length is monitored in the high-finesse range relative to an external standard: a single narrow transmission peak is locked to an external cavity diode laser and compared to an atomic frequency. Following standard locking schemes, tracking at sub-mm/s precision can be achieved. This is several orders of magnitude better than currently planned high-precision Doppler experiments. It allows freedom for relaxed designs rendering this approach particularly interesting for upcoming Doppler experiments. We also show that the large number of interference modes used in an FPI allows us to unambiguously identify the interference mode of each FPI transmission peak defining its absolute wavelength solution. The accuracy reached in each resonance with the laser concept is then defined by the cavity length that is determined from the one locked peak and by the group velocity dispersion. The latter can vary by several 100m/s over the relevant frequency range and severely limits the accuracy of individual peak locations. A potential way to determine the absolute peak positions is to externally measure the frequency of each individual peak with a laser frequency comb (LFC). Thus, the concept of laser-locked FPIs may be useful for applying the absolute accuracy of an LFC to astronomical spectrographs without the need for an LFC at the observatory.},

We report on the fabrication process of a test fiber and compare the optical properties, scrambling performance, and modal noise behavior of the D-fiber with those of common polygonal fibers.},

	abstract = {An important technique for discovering and characterizing planets beyond our solar system relies upon measurement of weak Doppler shifts in the spectra of host stars induced by the influence of orbiting planets. A recent advance has been the introduction of optical frequency combs as frequency references. Frequency combs produce a series of equally spaced reference frequencies and they offer extreme accuracy and spectral grasp that can potentially revolutionize exoplanet detection. Here we demonstrate a laser frequency comb using an alternate comb generation method based on electro-optical modulation, with the comb centre wavelength stabilized to a molecular or atomic reference. In contrast to mode-locked combs, the line spacing is readily resolvable using typical astronomical grating spectrographs. Built using commercial off-the-shelf components, the instrument is relatively simple and reliable. Proof of concept experiments operated at near-infrared wavelengths were carried out at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Keck-II telescope.},

Unlike previous planet-finding instruments, which are seeing-limited, iLocater operates at the diffraction limit and uses single mode fibers to eliminate the effects of modal noise entirely. By receiving starlight from two 8.4m diameter telescopes that each use “extreme” adaptive optics (AO), iLocater shows promise to overcome the limitations that prevent existing instruments from generating sub-meter-per-second radial velocity (RV) precision. Although optimized for the characterization of low-mass planets using the Doppler technique, iLocater will also advance areas of research that involve crowded fields, line-blanketing, and weak absorption lines.{\textbackslash}n},

	abstract = {An optical imaging system forms an object image by recollecting light scattered by the object. However, intact optical information of the object delivered through the imaging system is deteriorated by imperfect optical elements and unwanted defects. Image deconvolution, also known as inverse filtering, has been widely exploited as a recovery technique because of its practical feasibility, and operates by assuming the linear shift-invariant property of the imaging system. However, shift invariance is not rigorously hold in all imaging situations and it is not a necessary condition for solving the inverse problem of light propagation. Here, we present a method to solve the linear inverse problem of coherent light propagation without assuming shift invariance. Full characterization of imaging capability of the system is achieved by successively recording optical responses, using various laser illumination angles which are systematically controlled by a digital micro-mirror device. Experimental results show that image distortions caused by optical defocus can be restored by conventional deconvolution, but severe aberrations produced by a tilted lens or an inserted disordered layer can be corrected only by the proposed generalized image deconvolution. This work generalizes the theory of optical imaging and deconvolution, and enables distortion-free imaging under any general imaging condition.},

The results describe aberration limits for imaging with multimode fibers as in, e.g., microendoscopy.},

To develop a fully Bayesian least squares deconvolution (LSD) that can be applied to the reliable detection of magnetic signals in noise-limited stellar spectropolarimetric observations using multiline techniques. Methods. We consider LSD under the Bayesian framework and we introduce a flexible Gaussian Process (GP) prior for the LSD profile. This prior allows the result to automatically adapt to the presence of signal. We exploit several linear algebra identities to accelerate the calculations. The final algorithm can deal with thousands of spectral lines in a few seconds. Results. We demonstrate the reliability of the method with synthetic experiments and we apply it to real spectropolarimetric observations of magnetic stars. We are able to recover the magnetic signals using a small number of spectral lines, together with the uncertainty at each velocity bin. This allows the user to consider if the detected signal is reliable. The code to compute the Bayesian LSD profile is freely available.},

Here, we present systematical investigation and optimization of the second-harmonic generation in a dual-resonant aluminum nitride microring resonator. By optimizing the quality factor, independently engineering the coupling conditions for dual- band operation, and perfectly fulfilling phase-match conditions through thermal tuning, we demonstrate a second- harmonic generation efficiency of 2500\% W−1 in the low-pump-power regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is a state-of-the-art value among all the integrated photonic platforms. We also study the high-power regime where the pump power depletion is non-negligible. A conversion efficiency of 12\% is realized with 27 mW pump power. Our high-efficiency second-harmonic generator enables integrated frequency conversion and frequency locking between visible and infrared systems, and our approach can also apply to other photonic platforms.},

We find that the output spectrum depends on the waveguide poling period, indicating that quasi-phase-matching plays a significant role.

	abstract = {Optical fibres are essential for many types of highly multiplexed and precision spectroscopy. The success of the new generation of multifibre instruments under construction to investigate fundamental problems in cosmology, such as the nature of dark energy, requires accurate modellization of the fibre system to achieve their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goals. Despite their simple construction, fibres exhibit unexpected behaviour including non-conservation of etendue (focal ratio degradation, FRD) and modal noise. Furthermore, new fibre geometries (non-circular or tapered) have become available to improve the scrambling properties that, together with modal noise, limit the achievable SNR in precision spectroscopy. These issues have often been addressed by extensive tests on candidate fibres and their terminations, but these are difficult and time-consuming. Modelling by ray tracing and wave analysis is possible with commercial software packages, but these do not address the more complex features, in particular FRD.We use a phase-tracking ray-tracing method to provide a practical description of FRD derived from our previous experimental work on circular fibres and apply it to non-standard fibres. This allows the relationship between scrambling and FRD to be quantified for the first time. We find that scrambling primarily affects the shape of the near-field pattern but has negligible effect on the barycentre. FRD helps to homogenize the near-field pattern but does not make it completely uniform. Fibres with polygonal cross-section improve scrambling without amplifying the FRD. Elliptical fibres, in conjunction with tapering, may offer an efficient means of image slicing to improve the product of resolving power and throughput, but the result is sensitive to the details of illumination. We also investigated the performance of fibres close to the limiting numerical aperture since this may affect the uniformity of the SNR for some prime focus fibre instrumentation.},

For this application the frequency stability of the etalon is critical, as its transmission spectrum is susceptible to frequency fluctuations due to changes in cavity temperature, optical power and input polarization. In this paper we present a laser frequency comb measurement technique to characterize the frequency stability of a custom-designed fiber Fabry-Pérot interferometer (FFP). Simultaneously probing the stability of two etalon resonance modes, we assess both the absolute stability of the etalon and the long-term stability of the cavity dispersion. We measure mode positions with MHz precision, which corresponds to splitting the FFP resonances by a part in 500 and to RV precision of ≈ 1 m s−1. We address limiting systematic effects, including the presence of parasitic etalons, that need to be overcome to push the metrology of this system to the equivalent RV precision of 10 cm s−1. Our results demonstrate a means to characterize environmentally-driven perturbations of etalon resonance modes across broad spectral bandwidths, as well as motivate the benefits and challenges of FFPs as spectrograph calibrators.},

Our deconvolution method gives results that are, in at least some cases, superior to those of other commonly used techniques: in particular, it does not produce ringing around point sources superposed on a smooth background. Moreover, it allows researchers to perform accurate astrometry and photo- metry of crowded Ðelds. These improvements are a consequence of both the correct treatment of sampling and the recognition that the most probable astronomical image is not a Ñat one.

Since aluminum nitride exhibits both quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, the spectra feature simultaneous contributions from numerous nonlinear mechanisms: supercontinuum generation, difference-frequency generation, second-harmonic generation, and third-harmonic generation. As one application of integrating multiple nonlinear processes, we measure and stabilize the carrier-envelope-offset frequency of a laser comb by direct photodetection of the output light. Additionally, we generate {\textasciitilde}0.3 mW in the 3000 nm to 4000 nm region, which is potentially useful for molecular spectroscopy. The combination of broadband light generation from the visible through the mid-infrared, combined with simplified self-referencing, provides a path towards robust comb systems for spectroscopy and metrology in the field.},

This continuum generation process is caused by a combination of nonlinear optical effects including the formation of dispersive waves. Optical analogues of Cherenkov radiation, these waves allow a pulse to radiate power into a distant spectral region. In this work, efficient and coherent dispersive wave generation of visible to ultraviolet light is demonstrated in silica waveguides on a silicon chip. Unlike fibre broadeners, the arrays provide a wide range of emission wavelength choices on a single, compact chip. This new capability is used to simplify offset frequency measurements of a mode-locked frequency comb. The arrays can also enable mode-locked lasers to attain unprecedented tunable spectral reach for spectroscopy, bioimaging, tomography and metrology.},

Fiber motion is the usual cause of such speckle change, and Daino et al. have studied the first-order statistics of such modal noise, assuming a single frequency source. But source frequency variation can also cause modal noise; and source frequency diversity has been shown effective in its reduction. In this paper we use a speckle theory approach to study the frequency dependence of modal noise. We have measured and analyzed the correlation of two speckle patterns as a function of source frequency difference, and the speckle spatial frequency distribution as a function of fiber parameters. We have also measured the speckle contrast as a function of fiber length for several sources and fiber types. Such information permits the prediction of the modal noise statistics, from which corresponding changes in error rates can be derived.},

The project detected dozens of exoplanets with orbital periods ranging from a few days to several years. The Lick survey identified the first planet in an eccentric orbit (70 Virginis) and the first multi-planet system around a normal main sequence star (Upsilon Andromedae). These discoveries advanced our understanding of planet formation and orbital migration. Data from this project helped to quantify a correlation between host star metallicity and the occurrence rate of gas giant planets. The program also served as a test bed for innovation with testing of a tip-tilt system at the Coud´e focus and fiber scrambler designs to stabilize illumination of the spectrometer optics. The Lick Planet Search with the Hamilton Spectrograph effectively ended when a heater malfunction compromised the integrity of the iodine cell.

To find a 1-Earth-mass planet in an Earth-like orbit, a precision of {\textasciitilde}5 cm s-1 is necessary. The combination of a laser frequency comb with a Fabry–Pérot filtering cavity has been suggested as a promising approach to achieve such Doppler shift resolution via improved spectrograph wavelength calibration2, 3, 4, with recent encouraging results5.

This wide-line-spacing comb, or ‘astro-comb’, is well matched to the resolving power of high-resolution astrophysical spectrographs.

Such `frequency combs' provide a series of narrow modes which are uniformly spaced according to the laser's pulse repetition rate and whose absolute frequencies are known a priori with relative precision better than 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}. Simulations of frequency comb spectra show that the photon-limited wavelength calibration precision achievable with existing echelle spectrographs should be {\textasciitilde}1 cm/s when integrated over a 4000A range. Moreover, comb spectra may be used to accurately characterise distortions of the wavelength scale introduced by the spectrograph and detector system. The simulations show that frequency combs with pulse repetition rates of 5-30GHz are required, given the typical resolving power of existing and possible future echelle spectrographs. Achieving such high repetition rates, together with the desire to produce all comb modes with uniform intensity over the entire optical range, represent the only significant challenges in the design of a practical system. Frequency comb systems may remove wavelength calibration uncertainties from all practical spectroscopic experiments, even those combining data from different telescopes over many decades.},

Reaching these ambitious goals will require further improvements in instrumentation and new analysis tools. In this chapter, we provide an overview of five observational techniques that are currently employed in the detection of exoplanets: optical and infrared (IR) Doppler measurements, transit photometry, direct imaging, microlensing, and astrometry. We provide a basic description of how each of these techniques works and discuss forefront developments that will result in new discoveries. We also highlight the observational limitations and synergies of each method and their connections to future space missions.},

Based on the central idea of the deconvolution algorithm proposed by Magain, Courbin \& Sohy (1998), the method aims at improving the resolution of the data rather than at completely removing the point spread function (PSF). Improvements over the original method include a better regularization of the pixel channel of the image, based on wavelet filtering and multiscale analysis, and a better controlled separation of the point source vs. the extended source. In addition, the method is able to simultaneously deconvolve many individual frames of the same object taken with different instruments under different PSF conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a general geometric transformation between individual images. This transformation allows the combination of the images without having to interpolate them. We illustrate the capability of our algorithm using real and simulated images with complex diffraction-limited PSF.},

The required optical bandwidth to implement self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a path towards the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and that are compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by applying conventional, fiber based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical spectrum that spans two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f-3f self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio frequency reference the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and track the continuous wave pump laser's frequency. This work demonstrates the principal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide microwave-to-optical clockworks on a chip.},

This optical fiber serves as a powerful tool to image waves in a system where light rays exhibit a chaotic dynamics. We show that, in the speckle regime, the experimentally measured statistical properties of intensity patterns are well accounted for by a "random Gaussian" hypothesis.

The large data set of more than 44,000 spectra allows us to identify an empirical baseline floor for chromospheric activity as a function of color and height above the main sequence. We define ΔS as an excess in emission in the Ca ii H and K lines above the baseline activity floor and define radial velocity jitter as a function of ΔS and B−V for main-sequence and subgiant stars. Although the jitter for any individual star can always exceed the baseline level, we find that K dwarfs have the lowest level of jitter. The lack of correlation between observed jitter and chromospheric activity in K dwarfs suggests that the observed jitter is dominated by instrumental or analysis errors and not astrophysical noise sources. Thus, given the long-term precision for the CPS program, radial velocities are not correlated with astrophysical noise for chromospherically quiet K dwarf stars, making these stars particularly well suited for the highest precision Doppler surveys. Chromospherically quiet F and G dwarfs and subgiants exhibit higher baseline levels of astrophysical jitter than K dwarfs. Despite the fact that the rms in Doppler velocities is correlated with the mean chromospheric activity, it is rare to see one-to-one correlations between the individual time series activity and Doppler measurements, diminishing the prospects for correcting activity-induced velocity variations in F and G dwarfs.},

Absolute calibration provides the radial velocity of an astronomical object relative to the observer (on Earth). For the detection of Earth-mass exoplanets in Earth-like orbits around solar-type stars, or of cosmic acceleration, the observable is a tiny velocity change of less than 10 cm s(-1), where the repeatability of the calibration--the variation in stability across observations--is important. Hitherto, only laboratory systems or spectrograph calibrations of limited performance have been demonstrated. Here we report the calibration of an astronomical spectrograph with a short-term Doppler shift repeatability of 2.5 cm s(-1), and use it to monitor the star HD 75289 and recompute the orbit of its planet. This repeatability should make it possible to detect Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of star or even to measure the cosmic acceleration directly.},

We present here the scientific validation of the upgrade of this instrument, demonstrating a real improvement. The upgraded instrument, renamed SOPHIE+, reaches radial velocity precision in the range of 1-2 m/s.

Optical fiber technology is found in a wide variety of applications to flexibly relay light between two points, enabling information transfer across long distances and allowing access to hard-to-reach areas. Large-core optical fibers and light guides find frequent use in illumination and spectroscopic applications, for example, endoscopy and high-resolution astronomical spectroscopy. Proper alignment is critical for maximizing throughput in optical fiber coupling systems; however, there currently are no formal approaches to tolerancing the alignment of a lightguide coupling system. Here, we propose a Fourier alignment sensitivity (FAS) algorithm to determine the optimal tolerances on the alignment of a light guide by computing the alignment sensitivity. The algorithm shows excellent agreement with both simulated and experimentally measured values and improves on the computation time of equivalent ray-tracing simulations by two orders of magnitude. We then apply FAS to tolerance and fabricate a coupling system, which is shown to meet specifications, thus validating FAS as a tolerancing technique. These results indicate that FAS is a flexible and rapid means to quantify the alignment sensitivity of a light guide, widely informing the design and tolerancing of coupling systems.},

It follows the same fundamental principles as the ``MCS image deconvolution algorithm'' (Magain, Courbin, Sohy, 1998) and uses information contained in the spectrum of a reference Point Spread Function (PSF) to spatially deconvolve spectra of very blended sources. An improved resolution rather than an infinite one is aimed at, overcoming the well known problem of ``deconvolution artefacts''. As in the MCS algorithm, the data are decomposed into a sum of analytical point sources and a numerically deconvolved background, so that the spectrum of extended sources in the immediate vicinity of bright point sources may be accurately extracted and sharpened. The algorithm has been tested on simulated data including seeing variation as a function of wavelength and atmospheric refraction. It is shown that the spectra of severely blended point sources can be resolved while fully preserving the spectrophotometric properties of the data. Extended objects ``hidden'' by bright point sources (up to 4-5 magnitudes brighter) can be accurately recovered as well, provided the data have a sufficiently high total signal-to-noise ratio (200-300 per spectral resolution element). Such spectra are relatively easy to obtain, even down to faint magnitudes, within a few hours of integration time with 10m class telescopes.},
