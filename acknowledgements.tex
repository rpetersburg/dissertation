Dissertation Committee, especially Debra and Andy.

Yale's incredible music community, including YSM, YSO, YCB, OTYC, BCO, etc.

Graduate Student Assembly, especially Lucy, for showing me that the good faith actions of individuals can absolutely make a difference even in a place as gargantuan as an Ivy League Institution.

Other friends that I've made along the way: Duncan, Kelly, etc.

Mom, Dad, and Lauren: thank you for being the true constant in this entire process. Though we may have been states away, I always knew I could count on you to answer the phone and keep me motivated in reaching the light at the end of the tunnel.
